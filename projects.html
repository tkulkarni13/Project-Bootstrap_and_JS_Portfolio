                                This API allows users to manage data in an e-commerce setting.
                                The user can access API requests relating to customer management,
                                customer account management, product management, and orders management.
                                For each of these categories, there are routes to create new datapoints,
                                read datapoints, update datapoints, and delete datapoints.
                                The data is stored in a SQL database using Flask-SQLAlchemy for integration.
                                In addition, there are routes with bonus funcionality if needed by the user.
                                There is capability to view and manage stock levels of individual products,
                                and an automatic restocking function when stock is low. A user could also view
                                the complete order history of a specific customer, or calculate the total price of an order.

                                This application allows user to manage a library system via command line inputs.
                                There are 3 core components to this library management system.
                                Users are able to store information about books, users, authors.
                                Users can add new books, users, and authors, to the system, and search for
                                each of these at a later time. The newly added data is stored in a SQL database.
                                There is also functionality to check out a book, and return it at a later date.
                                There is one copy of each book available until checked out. Once a
                                book has been checked out, it must be returned before it can be checked out
                                again. All checked out books are stored in a table with a borrow and return date.
                                This can be accessed to see overall how often people are using the library system.
                                There is also functionality to view all books, authors, and users in the system.
                                Users can also search for specific books by their title or isbn.
                                This allows users to easily see which books are available and which arent.
